# ETH_Crypto-Exploration

This exploration data analysis focused on the past 18 months of ETH closing prices. The goal of the exploration is to find paticular patterns and properties of Etherem. The time-series model is aimed to achieve stationarity and could provide prediction power for future references. The input used in building the model is log-return of Etherem.

The RMD file shows relevant packages and ARMA / GARCH model we used in the analysis. The output with ACF/PACF graph, Goodness-of-Fit test, Garch Model Test and return predictions are shown in the HTML file.
